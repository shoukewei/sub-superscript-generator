## Printing Math-Friendly Strings in Python Without LaTeX
Using Unicode Subscripts and Superscripts for Clean Console Output

If you’ve ever written math-related Python code, you probably tried printing variables like x^2 or A_{1}. In Jupyter Notebooks or LaTeX environments, $x^{2}$ or $A_{1}$ works beautifully. But in a plain Python console, it looks messy:

x^{2}
A_{1}
H_{2}O
Not very readable.

A better solution is to use Unicode subscripts and superscripts, which render directly in console output without LaTeX. This way, you get:

x²
A₁
H₂O
Clean. Simple. Professional.
